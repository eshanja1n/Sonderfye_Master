## Inspiration
Over the summer after our junior year, we were trying very hard to find a job. The problem was we didn't have any money for business cards, so it was hard for us to compete with others and stand out to employers. However, we did have some knowledge in programming, thus we sought to solve this problem by creating an easy way for people to stand out and advance their careers. 
## What it does
Sonderfye eliminates the complications with creating personal websites. Previously, users had to deal with learning HTML on their own, not to mention figuring out how to host a site. This can be very frustrating for beginners, and takes up a lot of their time and money. With Sonderfye, users simply make an account and are given a easy to use form that takes their information and generates a personalized site for free. 
## How we built it
We used HTML and CSS for the website development. Utilizing JavaScript and PHP, we created the backend of this project. We also created a database to store user data on Google Firebase and used Firebase Authentication to create accounts. 
## Challenges we ran into
Haven never used PHP very heavily before, we ran into issues when trying to generate the sites. We had trouble taking the inputted user data and using PHP to create a brand new site for the user. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to figure out how to use PHP and create automated sites for users. It was very challenging, but we ended up finding a way to make it work. More, we are happy with the way we create user accounts and how we were able to utilize Firebase for authenticating users. 
## What we learned
In creating Sonderfye, we sharpened our web dev skills while improving our backend abilities. After never having used PHP, we came out of this projects with a good understand of how it works and how to use it for future projects. 
## What's next for Sonderfye
Our first idea to improve on Sonderfye is to allow users to choose from a variety of templates, rather than only getting a single choice for the theme of the website. Additionally, we want to add an option that allows users to add a head shot picture of themselves. We had a lot of fun creating this project, and we will definitely be working on these ideas after Lancer Hacks ends.
